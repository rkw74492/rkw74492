                <p>â€¦was the nom de plume of Charles Lutwidge
                    Dodgson, a renowned English logician, photographer, writer, and mathematician.
                    He was born on January
                    27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England, and passed away on
                    January 14, 1898, in Guildford, Surrey, England. Carroll is best known for his
                    imaginative literary works, in particular "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and
                    its sequel, "Through the Looking-Glass."</p>
                <p> Dodgson was the eldest son in a family of eleven children. He displayed an early aptitude for
                    mathematics and showed
                    great promise in the subject. In 1851, he enrolled at Oxford University's Christ
                    Church, where he eventually became a mathematical lecturer and remained closely
                    associated with the institution for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p> It was during Dodgson's time at Oxford that he began developing the stories that would later become
                    "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." In 1862, while on a boating trip with the
                    Liddell family, Dodgson told a tale to entertain the children, including Alice
                    Liddell. Encouraged by the positive reception, he later expanded the story into a
                    manuscript, and it was published in 1865 under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The
                    book's whimsical characters, imaginative plot, and clever wordplay made it an
                    instant success and a beloved classic of children's literature.</p>
                <p> Following the success of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," Carroll published "Through the
                    Looking-Glass" in 1871, which continued the fantastical adventures of Alice.
                    Both books garnered critical acclaim and have since become enduring classics,
                    celebrated for their blend of fantasy, satire, and linguistic playfulness.</p>
                <p> In addition to his literary pursuits, Carroll was also an accomplished mathematician
                    and logician. He wrote several books on mathematics, including "The Game of Logic"
                    and "Symbolic Logic," which showcased his logical and analytical abilities. Carroll's
                    interest in logic and puzzles is evident in his literary works, where he employed
                    riddles, paradoxes, and absurd situations.</p>
                <p> Apart from writing and mathematics, Carroll had a passion for photography. He was an early adopter
                    of the medium and
                    became skilled in the art. Carroll photographed a wide range of subjects, including
                    children, famous personalities, and landscapes. His photographic work remains
                    influential, particularly his portraits of children.</p>
                <p> Lewis Carroll's life was marked
                    by his imaginative and creative endeavors. While his literary works brought him
                    widespread fame, he remained a private and somewhat enigmatic figure. Carroll's
                    contributions to children's literature, mathematics, and photography continue to
                    be celebrated, and his works have left an indelible mark on the world of imagination
                    and whimsy.</p>
