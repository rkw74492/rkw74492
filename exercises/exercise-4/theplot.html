        <h2>The Plot Of Katamari Damacy</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The King of All Cosmos, a supreme, immense, omnipotent, flamboyant cosmic being bigger than Earth itself, got a bit too drunk and destroyed the cosmos in the process. The sky is now empty, which is a bit of a problem, as anyone could guess. <br/>You play as the Prince of All Cosmos, a miniscule being; exponentially smaller than their father, the King; whose voice is too small to be heard but whose determination and perserverence are unmatched. <br/>The King, after sobering up, realises that destroying all the stars in the sky is a bit of an issue, so he sends you, his son, to <strong>Roll The Katamari.</strong> By rolling the Katamari, The Prince (you) will slowly contribute to restoring the night sky around the Earth by rolling up the things that are on earth to make the stars. </p>
